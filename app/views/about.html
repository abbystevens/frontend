			<h2>About</h2>
			<h4>Behind the Curtain is a project created by Hack Oregon, a community-powered nonprofit building civic data projects to promote engagement, awareness, and quality of life.</h4>
			<br>
			<p>We know that when it comes to public data, transparency doesn’t always equal clarity.  The industry standard for design and technology products today is quite amazing. Most of us expect a charming, responsive, well-executed application just to order a pizza or to book a hotel.
			<br><br>
			But the fact is, most government web technology is a world away from the private sector. The creative and technical talent powering professional web development teams is competitive and expensive—- and at a time when school districts are struggling to find funding to serve healthy nutritious lunches, it’s understandable that tax-payer money isn't getting flooded into mobile-first approaches to municipal calendar-event apps.
			<br><br>
			In many ways, we have only begun to scratch the surface of how democratization of information can affect our relationship with the place we live.  Cities are complex organizational structures—- and as you can imagine—- they generate a lot of data. Though much of it is technically “transparent”, it takes a combination of hard work and insight to turn that data into understandable information.
			<br><br>
			Hack Oregon is able to take on projects that are fundamentally needed, but perhaps aren't a natural fit for a venture-capital backed business models and shouldn't compete for tax payer dollars.
			<br><br>
			It works because we reach across community platforms to bring together special teams of volunteer-professionals for each project we take on. Our process emphasizes visual thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration; and while some may call it experimental— we are excited to see what happens when you design for equity of information. Would people trust the system more if they knew what went on behind the curtain? Would they take action if they saw a clear path to change? 
			<br><br>
			The way we see it, if knowledge is power— data is accountability.
			<br><br>
			We’re claiming our power Oregon.
